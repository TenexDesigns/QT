Qt is a popular C++ framework that's widely known for its cross-platform capabilities, including mobile app development. Here are the pros, cons, advantages, and aspects of using Qt for mobile app development:

**Pros:**

1. **Cross-Platform:** Qt is designed to be cross-platform, which means you can write code once and deploy it on multiple platforms, including desktop, mobile, and embedded systems.

2. **Native Performance:** Qt apps are compiled into native machine code, resulting in better performance compared to interpreted languages in some cases.

3. **Native Look and Feel:** Qt provides access to native APIs, allowing you to create apps that have a native look and feel on each platform.

4. **Rich Set of Libraries:** Qt offers a wide range of libraries for various tasks, including UI, networking, databases, graphics, and more.

5. **UI Development:** Qt provides tools like Qt Quick and Qt Widgets for building user interfaces. Qt Quick is especially useful for creating modern, fluid UIs using QML (Qt Modeling Language).

6. **Modularity and Extensibility:** Qt's modular architecture allows you to add or remove components as needed, making it flexible and customizable.

7. **Community and Support:** Qt has an active community and commercial support options, which can be helpful during development.

8. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** Qt Creator is a powerful IDE that offers features like code highlighting, debugging, and a UI designer for Qt Quick.

**Cons:**

1. **Learning Curve:** If you're new to C++ or the Qt framework, there can be a learning curve, especially when dealing with certain complex features.

2. **C++ Complexity:** C++ is a more complex language compared to some other options, which might increase development time and potential for errors.

3. **Platform-Specific Tweaks:** Despite providing access to native APIs, you might still need to make platform-specific adjustments for certain features or optimizations.

4. **UI Design:** While Qt Quick and QML provide a modern way to design UIs, the syntax might be unfamiliar if you're used to more traditional UI design tools.

**Advantages:**

1. **High Performance:** Qt apps are compiled into native code, providing good performance for resource-intensive applications.

2. **Full Control:** Qt gives you fine-grained control over your application's behavior and appearance.

3. **Code Reusability:** Code can be shared between different platforms, reducing the need to write separate implementations.

4. **Community and Resources:** Qt has a strong community with ample resources, including documentation, forums, and tutorials.

**Aspects:**

1. **Qt Widgets:** Classic UI components and framework for desktop-style applications.

2. **Qt Quick:** Modern, declarative UI framework based on QML for creating fluid, dynamic UIs.

3. **Qt for Android and iOS:** Provides the ability to create native-like apps for Android and iOS using C++ and Qt.

4. **Qt Creator:** Integrated development environment designed for Qt development.

**Ease of Use:**

The ease of use with Qt depends on your familiarity with C++ and your previous experience with other UI frameworks. If you're comfortable with C++ and have a strong programming background, Qt can be relatively straightforward to work with, especially if you use Qt Quick and QML for UI design. However, if you're new to C++ or prefer a more high-level, visual approach to UI design, there might be a learning curve.

In summary, Qt for mobile app development offers high performance, cross-platform capabilities, and a range of libraries. However, it requires a good understanding of C++ and the Qt framework. If you're comfortable with these technologies and value the native performance and control that C++ provides, Qt can be a powerful choice for building mobile apps.
